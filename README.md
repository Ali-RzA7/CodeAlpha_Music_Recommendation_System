# Music Recommendation System üé∂

This project is a **Music Recommendation System** developed as part of a task from **CodeAlpha**. The system analyzes song features and recommends similar tracks based on the user's preferences, using clustering and distance-based algorithms.

## Project Overview

The Music Recommendation System uses a combination of **K-Means Clustering**, **t-SNE**, and **PCA** for feature reduction, along with distance metrics such as **Hamming**, **Cosine**, and **Euclidean** to recommend songs that align with a user's music taste.

### Features

- **Personalized Music Recommendations**: Provides song recommendations based on user preferences.
- **Advanced Data Analysis**: The project uses **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data handling, and **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for data visualization.
- **Innovative Distance Metrics**: Leverages **Cosine**, **Hamming**, and **Euclidean distances** for song similarity analysis.
